	 * All the expressions in the {@code with} statement work in a scope, where the implicit {@code this} gets resolved
	 * by the specified {@code implicitThisExpression}. With the magic symbol {@code _} the
	 * {@code implicitThisExpression} can used explicitly. More importantly the explicit {@code this} is not affected by
	 * the {@code with} statement.
	 * <p>
	 * For the time being there are two use-cases:
	 * <p>
	 * 1. Initialization
	 * 
	 * <pre>
	 * JFrame frame = with(new JFrame(), setTitle(&quot;Application&quot;), setResizable(false), setFrameIcon(this.ICON), setLayout(new BorderLayout()),
	 * 		add(this.createButton(), BorderLayout.SOUTH), pack(), setVisible(true));
	 * </pre>
	 * 
	 * 2. Chaining non-fluent API
	 * 
	 * <pre>
	 * List&lt;String&gt; list1 = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();
	 * String s = with(list1, add(&quot;Hello&quot;), add(&quot;World&quot;)).toString();
	 * </pre>
	 * 
	 * <b>Note:</b> This is an experimental feature and might not work in some cases or the behavior might change rather
	 * drastically. Still, please file a bug report if you stumble over anything weird.
