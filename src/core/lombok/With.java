	 * All the expressions in the {@code with} statement work on a scope, where the implicit {@code this} gets resolved by the specified
	 * {@code implicitThisExpression}. With the magic symbol {@code _} the {@code implicitThisExpression} can used
	 * explicitly. More importantly the explicit {@code this} is not affected by the {@code with} statement.
	 * <p>
	 * For the time being there are two use-cases:
	 * <p>
	 * 1. Initialization
	 * <pre>
	 * {@code
	 * JFrame frame = with(new JFrame(),
	 *                  setTitle("Application"),
	 *                  setResizable(false),
	 *                  setFrameIcon(this.ICON),
	 *                  setLayout(new BorderLayout()),
	 *                  add(this.createButton(), BorderLayout.SOUTH),
	 *                  pack(),
	 *                  setVisible(true));
	 * }
	 * </pre>
	 * <p>
	 * 2. Chaining non-fluent API
	 * <pre>
	 * {@code
	 * List<String> list1 = new ArrayList<String>();
	 * String s = with(list1,
	 *              add("Hello"),
	 *              add("World")).toString();
	 * }
	 * </pre>
	 * <p>
	 * <b>Note:</b> This is a highly experimental feature. I'm still not sure that I like the way it works right now.
