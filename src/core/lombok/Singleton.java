/**
 * The nicest singleton templates of them all.

 * Before:
 * <pre>
 * &#64;Singleton
 * class MySingleton {
 *   public MySingleton() {
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * After:
 * <pre>
 * enum MySingleton {

 *   }
 *
 *   public static MySingleton getInstance() {

 * <b>Note:</b> If you don't like the enum-approach, try the classic singleton using<br>
 * {@code @Singleton(style = Singleton.Style.HOLDER)}.
