These are the patches one need to apply to the lombok code base in order to
prepare a lombok version that lombok-pg can run with.

Changes:

[0001-data-super-true-part1.patch]

  @Data(super=true) works for @ToString and @EqualsAndHashCode
  (Note: This is one of the features, that will most likely end up in lombok once part 2 is done)

[0004-cleanup-and-closeable.patch]  

  @Cleanup is treated special to support Closeable
