These are the patches one need to apply to the lombok codebase in order to
prepare a lombok version that lombok-pg can run with.

Changes:

[0001-inner-class-Annotations.patch]

  allows lombok to handle inner class annotations such as @Validate.NotNull or @Builder.Extension

[0002-marker-Annotations-for-handlers.patch]

  enables a more convinient definition of annotation handler and ast visitors
  
[0003-data-super-true-part1.patch]

  @Data(super=true) works for @ToString and @EqualsAndHashCode
  (Note: This is one of the features, that will mostlikly end up in lombok once part 2 is done)
